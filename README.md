# AB_Wiskadals_Fabrik
**About the Project:**
This is a short project to digitize a single double-page spread from the AB Wiskadals 1951-52 catalog. It exists to demonstrate basic ability in core competencies of digitization, but also to work towards a framework that could be used to digitize large archives of ephemera in Borås Textilmuseet and potentially elsewhere. This Project was completed for the course of **Digitising Cultural Heritage Material VT2023** taught at the **University of Borås**. 
**About the Developers:**
Two developers (Sanam Ali and Rachel Bayston) contributed to the completion of this project. Both were students of Masters Program: **Digital Library and Information Services** at University of Borås. More information can be found in the “About” page of the project’s website.
