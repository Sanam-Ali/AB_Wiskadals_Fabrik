    <h2 class="text-center">About the site</h2>
    <p>This website gives you access to scans and text from the AB Wiskadals clothing catalog. 

Top Layer reproduces the text in full, accompanied by the scanned images of the catalog pages.

Design at a Glance allows you to view details of garment design and style in tabular form. 

Files allows you to view and download the project files, including the TEI document as a .txt file, a PDF of the project, and the images of the source document as JPGs. 

With the exception of this page, the site was built by transforming the TEI file using XSLT stylesheet.
</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">About the project</h2>
    <p>This is a short project to digitize a single double-page spread from the AB Wiskadals 1951-52 catalog. It exists to demonstrate basic ability in core competencies of digitization, but also to work towards a framework that could be used to digitize large archives of ephemera in Borås Textilmuseet and potentially elsewhere.</p>
